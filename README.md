### Hi, I'm HugLep ðŸ‘‹
I'm a young devloper, I ussually code in Python, but I like learn about new languages. I would like to learn how AI works and how code it.

#### In progress
- I do the [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home), to have a solid foundation in computer science.
- I learn how to create apps with Flutter.
#### Done
- I have made a mobile game called [Gravitax](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HuGames.Gravitax&hl=fr), to learn how a game is done.
#### To do
- I'd like to learn more about AI, maybe do the [CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python) or something.
