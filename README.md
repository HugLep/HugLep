### Hi, I'm HugLep ðŸ‘‹
I'm a young devloper, I ussually code in Python, but I like learn about new languages. I would like to learn how AI works and how code it.

#### In progress
- I continue to develop my Python skills and try other languages just to try something new and have fun.
- I learn how to create apps with Flutter.
#### Done
- I have made a mobile game called [Gravitax](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HuGames.Gravitax&hl=fr), to learn how a game is done.
- I have made some small Python projects like a tic-tac-toe algorithm.
- I learned the basics of creating a website with the training courses like [Create your website with HTML5 and CSS3](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/1603881-creez-votre-site-web-avec-html5-et-css3), [Learn to program with JavaScript](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/7696886-apprenez-a-programmer-avec-javascript) and [Build your website with PHP and MySQL](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/918836-concevez-votre-site-web-avec-php-et-mysql)
#### To do
- I'd like to learn more about AI, maybe do the [CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python) or something.
